# DC3
DC3 Metric
This repository contains the data and code related to the "Developer-Centric Cognitive Complexity (DC3)": A Metric for Evaluating Code Comprehension Difficulty. The paper investigates the relationship between code complexity and the comprehension difficulty experienced by programmers when analyzing code.
Dataset
The dataset used in this study is included in the repository. It consists of a set of programs, varying in complexity, that were used for the experiment. Each program is labeled with the corresponding code complexity metrics, including McCabe and Halstead metrics, as well as cognitive complexity metrics obtained from SonarQube. The dataset also contains the EEG data captured during the experiment, which represents the cognitive load experienced by the programmers.

Code
The code included in this repository corresponds to the analysis and calculations performed on the dataset. It encompasses the implementation of the DC3 metric and the comparison with existing code complexity metrics. The code is provided in Matlab, and detailed instructions for running and reproducing the results can be found in the respective code files.

Replication
To replicate the experiment and reproduce the results presented in the paper, follow the steps below:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies as outlined in the provided instructions.
Run the code files in the specified order to perform the analysis on the dataset.
Review the generated results and compare them with the findings presented in the paper.
Experiment with different scenarios or datasets by modifying the code and dataset as required.
